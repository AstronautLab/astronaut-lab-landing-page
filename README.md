# Astronaut Lab

A basic landing page to give us a web presence, built on [React Static](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static). Shall we start a pool on how
many hits this site gets in a whole year?!

### Deployment

The `master` branch is automatically deployed to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

### Development

The first step is to clone the repository and install dependencies

```
$ git clone git@github.com:AstronautLab/astronaut-lab-landing-page.git
$ cd astronaut-lab-landing-page
$ yarn
```

Once you've done that, start the development server by running the below 
command. Any changes you make will automatically refresh in your browser

```
$ yarn start
```
